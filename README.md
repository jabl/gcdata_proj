# gcdata_proj
Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

All the code for downloading and uncompressing the raw data, creating
a tidy data set, and writing means of the tidy data set is found in
run_analysis.R.

run_analysis.R creates the file "tidymeans.txt", which is the file
created in part 5 of the project instructions, and uploaded to the
course web site for the evaluation.
