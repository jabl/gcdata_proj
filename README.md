# gcdata_proj
Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

All the code for downloading and uncompressing the raw data
(getUCIHARData()), creating a tidy data set (tidyUCIHAR()), and
writing means of the tidy data set (tidymeans() and final statement in
file) is found in run_analysis.R.

run_analysis.R creates the file "tidymeans.txt", which is the file
created in part 5 of the project instructions, and uploaded to the
course web site for the evaluation.
